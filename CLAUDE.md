### Critical Rules - DO NOT VIOLATE
- **NEVER create mock data or simplified components** unless explicitly told to do so
- **NEVER replace existing complex components with simplified versions** - always fix the actual problem
- **ALWAYS work with the existing codebase** - do not create new simplified alternatives
- **ALWAYS find and fix the root cause** of issues instead of creating workarounds
- **ALWAYS Track all changes in CHANGELOG.MD**
- **ALWAYS refer to CHANGELOG.MD when working on tasks**
- **Always make sure the App builds successfully**
- **Always scrub out all sensitive data in the repo**
- When debugging issues, focus on fixing the existing implementation, not replacing it
- When something doesn't work, debug and fix it - don't start over with a simple version
- docker should be built for platform="linux/amd64" 
- docker versioning should just be major.minor version ie 0.23
- docker always check what the next version should be before tagging, you can get this info from docker hub
- docker hub user and org are ttlequals0
- docker if you test locally cleanup afterwards
- Always follow claude.md
