  - Changed Files: 3-phase verification (start → check → rescan) for detecting and rescanning modified files

### Fixed
- **Critical Scan Performance Issue**: Fixed scan operations getting stuck at "Discovering files..." phase
  - Root cause: Loading 1M+ existing file paths into memory caused application hang
  - Solution: Implemented `DatabaseExistenceChecker` class that queries database on-demand during discovery

  - Added caching to prevent repeated database queries for the same file
  - Added progress logging to track discovery and add phases
  - Scan operations now complete successfully even with large databases (1M+ records)
- **Flask-Limiter Log Spam**: Fixed critical log spam issue causing thousands of ERROR messages per second

  - Added missing `phase_number`, `total_phases`, `phase_current`, `phase_total` fields to `/api/scan-status` response
  - Frontend now properly calculates progress percentage based on 3-phase system with 33% per phase:
    - **Phase 1 (0-33%)**: Discovery - Finding new files not in database
    - **Phase 2 (33-66%)**: Adding - Adding new files with basic metadata 
    - **Phase 3 (66-100%)**: Scanning - Integrity checking based on actual files to scan
  - Progress bar now shows meaningful percentages during all scan phases

- **"Mark as Good" UI Count Bug**: Fixed UI statistics not updating after marking single file as good
  - Added missing `await this.stats.updateStats()` call in `markFileAsGood()` method in app.js:1314
  - UI dashboard counts now immediately reflect changes when marking files as good
  - Bulk "mark as good" operation already worked correctly, now single-file operation matches

- **Scan Performance Optimization**: Implemented optimized 3-phase scan system
  - **Phase 1 (Discovery)**: Now only discovers NEW files not already in database, skipping known files
  - **Phase 2 (Adding)**: Adds new files to database with basic metadata before integrity checking
  - **Phase 3 (Scanning)**: Only performs corruption checks on new/changed files (unless force_rescan=true)
  - Dramatically improves scan performance for large libraries with few changes between scans

- **Orphaned Files Cleanup Now Deletes Database Entries**: Changed orphaned files scan behavior to actually remove database entries
  - **Phase 1**: Scanning database entries for all known files
  - **Phase 2**: Checking filesystem existence for each database entry

  - Updated progress tracking to show 3 phases instead of 2 (33.3% each phase)
  - Completion message now shows "Deleted X orphaned database entries" instead of "Found X orphaned entries"
  - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Previously only marked entries as `file_exists = False`, now actually removes them from database

## [2.0.75] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- **Directory Parsing Bug in ScanService**: Fixed critical bug where directory names were split into individual characters
  - ScanService was passing single directory strings to `discover_media_files()` which expects a list

## [2.0.16] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Targeted Rescan Implementation**:
  - Fixed rescan getting stuck in discovery phase for over 1 million files
  - Rescan now skips directly to Phase 3 (scanning) without discovery
  - Only processes the specific files marked as pending
  - Significantly faster rescan startup (immediate vs minutes of loading)
  - Proper progress tracking shows "Phase 3 of 3: Scanning"
  - Memory efficient - doesn't load all existing files

### Added
- **Collapsible Sidebar on Desktop**:

  - Each phase has its own progress tracking (e.g., "Phase 1 of 3: Discovery")
  - Discovery phase shows files checked and media files found
  - Database addition phase shows exact progress (e.g., "Added 450/1000 files")
  - Scanning phase shows file-by-file progress with percentage
- **Clearer Progress Messages**: Users now understand exactly what's happening
  - No more confusing "100% complete" when scan is just starting
  - Progress bar percentage reflects current phase progress, not overall
  - Phase indicators clearly show which step of the process is running
- **Better Progress Calculation**: 
  - Discovery phase uses indeterminate progress since total is unknown
  - Database addition and scanning phases show accurate percentages
  - Progress messages include specific details for each phase

### Fixed

  - When total files is 0, progress shows "Calculating..." instead of 100/100
  - Progress bar text shows actual status message when initializing
  - Only shows "Scan completed!" if files were actually scanned
- **False Completion Messages**: Prevented "Scan completed!" from showing on page load
  - Completion message only shows if total files > 0
  - Progress monitoring no longer triggers false completion when no scan is running

### Improved
- **Progress Calculation**: Better handling of edge cases
  - Completed files calculation now properly handles 0 total files
  - Progress bar width correctly shows 0% when initializing
  - More accurate progress display during scan initialization phase
